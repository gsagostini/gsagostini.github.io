      <p>I am a PhD student in <a href="https://infosci.cornell.edu">Information Science</a> at <a href="https://tech.cornell.edu">Cornell Tech</a>, working with <a href="https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~emmapierson/">Emma Pierson</a> and <a href="https://gargnikhil.com">Nikhil Garg</a>.</p>
      <p>My research leverages <b>spatial machine learning</b> methods and creates novel datasets to <b>inform more equitable urban policies</b>. I focus on addressing challenges related to sparse and biased spatial data: specifically, how to transform coarse, crowdsourced, and irregularly collected information into actionable insights for improved city resource allocation. </p>
      <p> In recent work, I examined <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11754">under-reporting bias in resident reporting</a> systems (such as New York City's 311), <a href="https://gsagostini.github.io/MIGRATE/">migration patterns in the United States at scale</a>, and disparate access to urban amenities. Currently, I work with the <a href="https://www.nyc.gov/html/dot/html/bicyclists/bicyclists.shtml">New York City Department of Transportation</a> to evaluate bike lane usage and bike ridership across the city. I rely on spatial analysis techniques combined with computational and statistical frameworks including Bayesian optimization, hierarchical modeling, and network analysis. You can find a full list of my past and ongoing work in the <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/publications">publications</a> tab. I also co-organize a working group on Urban Data Science under <a href="https://bridges.eaamo.org/working_groups/urban-ds-equitable-cities/">EAAMO Bridges</a>, and we are always looking for members or guest speakers--let me know if you would like to participate!</p>
      <p> Prior to joining Cornell, I earned a B.S. in Applied Mathematics and a B.A. in Urban Studies from Columbia University. I have written quite a lot about cities back then, and included some of this work under the <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/fun">fun</a> tab.</p>
