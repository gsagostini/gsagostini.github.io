I am a 1st-year PhD student in Information Science at Cornell Tech, working with [Emma Pierson](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/~emmapierson/) and [Nikhil Garg](https://gargnikhil.com) on computational social science problems. Prior to joining Cornell, I earned a Bachelor of Science in Applied Mathematics and a Bachelor of Arts in Urban Studies from Columbia University.

With my background in Mathematics, I have been exposed to rather abstract concepts which I would like to bring into the urban planning and social sciences discussion. I believe that the rigorous description of society through Statistics, Topology, or Graph Theory can help us understand better what are inherent properties of urban space and what can be improved. I am especially drawn to studying cities of the Global South and the mathematical meaning of urbanism for these cities, and to solving problems in public policy using Machine Learning with unreliable or sparse data---unfortunately, those two interests often intersect.

I am currently interested in spatial statistics, network science, and in the applications of these areas to the design and governance of better, more equitable cities. You can find more about me on my [CV](/files/Agostini_CV.pdf) and [GitHub](https://github.com/gsagostini).
