            <h1>Gabriel S. Agostini</h1>
            <p>I am a 3rd-year PhD student in <a href="https://infosci.cornell.edu">Information Science</a> at <a href="https://tech.cornell.edu">Cornell Tech</a>, working with <a href="https://www.cs.cornell.edu/~emmapierson/">Emma Pierson</a> and <a href="https://gargnikhil.com">Nikhil Garg</a> on Urban Data Science. Prior to joining Cornell, I earned a Bachelor of Science in Applied Mathematics and a Bachelor of Arts in Urban Studies from Columbia University.</p>
            <h2>My Research</h2>
            <p>With my background in Mathematics, I have been exposed to rather abstract concepts which I would like to bring into the urban planning and social sciences discussion. I believe that the rigorous description of society through Statistics, Topology, or Graph Theory can help us understand better what are inherent properties of urban space and what can be improved. I am especially drawn to studying cities of the Global South as well as underserved neighborhoods and the mathematical constraints of urbanism for these populations, and to solving problems in public policy using Machine Learning with unreliable or sparse data---unfortunately, those interests very often intersect.</p>
            <p>I am currently working on problems involving spatial statistics, network science, and applications of these areas to the design and governance of better, more equitable cities.</p>
