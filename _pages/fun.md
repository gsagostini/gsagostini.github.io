          <p>I have written a lot about cities and geography during my undergrad. Here is some of that work:</p>
          <p><b>Brazilian Urban Planning: </b></p>
          <ul>
            <li>In the essay <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/documents/urban/rio.pdf">Naturally Artificial: Continuity and Change in the Street Network of Rio de Janeiro</a>, I use street network analysis on historical maps to study the change in the street layout of Rio de Janeiro during the colonial period.</li> 
            <li>In the essay <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/documents/urban/confluences.pdf">Confluences of the Past in Brasília: Another Plano Piloto for Brazilian Modernist Urbanism</a>, I look at the eurocentric historiography that predominantly constrained Brazilian Modernism and propose alternative, de-colonial avenues for future research rooted within Brazil's own city-planning tradition. This piece was published on the <a href="https://www.bcurbanreview.com">Barnard Columbia Urban Review</a> Fall 2021 edition. I wrote <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/documents/urban/cannibalism.pdf">a review essay</a> on the same topic.</li> 
          </ul>
          <p><b>Architecture and Urban Planning through Art and Fiction: </b></p>
          <ul>
            <li>Still looking at modernism (and Brasília!), I discuss the dissonances between the British architectural collective <a href="https://www.archigram.net/about-archigram">Archigram</a> and modernist town planning in my essay <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/documents/urban/archigram.pdf">The Life of Yellowing Papers</a>, focusing on the meaning of participatory urbanism in both art and real life.</li>
            <li>Continuing on the theme of British literature and architecture, I use spatial analysis and GIS to study movement in B.S. Johnson's brutalist novel Albert Angelo as detailed in the essay <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/documents/urban/f-walking.pdf">OH, FUCK ALL THIS WALKING! The Metafictional Geography of Movement in Albert Angelo</a>. Hey, it wouldn't be brutalist enough if I didn't include the whole, uncensored, raw expletive here!</li>

      <div class="fun-list">
        <div class="fun-item">
          <p>I spend too much time not only listening but analyzing Taylor Swift songs. I also produce academic research on her music. Because I unfortunately have not yet found a reputable journal on Taylor Swift Studies to publish my work, you can read the preprints below:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/documents/taylorswift/CC.pdf">This essay</a>, which I wrote for my <a href="https://www.college.columbia.edu/core-curriculum/classes/contemporary-civilization">Columbia's Contemporary Civilization class</a> in 2021, investigates Swift's re-recordings and their ontological implications in Aesthetics. I use canonical texts from Western philosophy, such as Marx and Nietzsche, to support my point. </li> 
            <li>I had been thinking about these ideas much earlier in my Swiftie carreer, and <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/documents/taylorswift/UW.pdf">this essay</a> from 2017 focuses on the themes of memory and repetition in Taylor Swift's music as she released <i>reputation</i>.</li>
