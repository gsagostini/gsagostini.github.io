    <p>I am a PhD student in <a href="https://infosci.cornell.edu">Information Science</a> at <a href="https://tech.cornell.edu">Cornell Tech</a>, working with <a href="https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~emmapierson/">Emma Pierson</a> and <a href="https://gargnikhil.com">Nikhil Garg</a>.</p>
    <p>My research leverages spatial machine learning methods and creates novel datasets to inform more equitable urban policies. I focus on addressing challenges related to sparse and biased spatial data: specifically, how to transform coarse, crowdsourced, and irregularly collected information into actionable insights for improved city resource allocation. </p>
    <p> In recent work, I examined <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11754">under-reporting bias in resident reporting</a> systems (such as New York City's 311), <a href="https://gsagostini.github.io/MIGRATE/">migration patterns in the United States at scale</a>, and disparate access to urban amenities. I rely on spatial analysis techniques combined with computational and statistical frameworks including Bayesian optimization, hierarchical modeling, and network analysis.</p>
    <p> Prior to joining Cornell, I earned a B.S. in Applied Mathematics and a B.A. in Urban Studies from Columbia University.</p>
