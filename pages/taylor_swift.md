A Swiftie for life, I spend a significant amount of time listening to Taylor Swift's songs. I love all of her albums equally (especially the underrated debut!) but if you must know my top 3 is evermore, 1989, and Red. You can also disagree with my [rankings](../images/evermore_tracks.png) for the songs in evermore, and I am always happy to defend my favorites.

I also spend too much time theorizing about the meaning and rationale behind Swift's songs. As a matter of fact, I have even written two papers while at Columbia discussing Taylor Swift. Because I unfortunately have not yet found a reputable journal on Taylor Swift Studies to publish my work, you can read them below---and drop me a message if you do so and enjoy them:

- [This essay](../files/taylor_swift_cc.pdf), which I wrote for [Columbia's Contemporary Civilization](https://www.college.columbia.edu/core/conciv) class during my senior year, investigates Swift's re-recordings and their ontologival implications in Aesthetics. I use canonical texts from Western philosophy, such as Marx and Nietzsche, to support my point. Especial thanks to my professor Jerónimo Duarte-Riascos who gave me brilliant feedback on this essay.

- [This essay](../files/taylor_swift_uw.pdf), originally for my first-year writing seminar, was written in 2017 when reputation had just been relesead and investigates the musical qualities that are constant and variable throughout Taylor Swift's carreer.

If you are also excited about Taylor Swift and want to discuss your interpretations of every vault song in Fearless TV, or are anxious for the 10 minute version of All Too Well, drop me a message!
