One of my main hobbies is to make cocktails at home. I am obviously a fan of the classics: gin & tonics and negronis are my all-time favorite drinks. However what I really enjoy is experimenting with new flavors and combinations. I enjoy playing with variations on drinks that add unusual spirits---mezcal and cachaça are always present in my home bar---or attempting to create a new cocktail altogether.

Below are a few of my favorite authoral drinks, which I have poorly named. Please let me know if you think of better names for them.
