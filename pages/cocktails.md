description: check out my authoral cocktails
---

One of my main hobbies is to make cocktails at home. I am obviously a fan of the classics: gin & tonics and negronis are my all-time favorite drinks. However what I really enjoy is experimenting with new flavors and combinations. I enjoy playing with variations on drinks that add unusual spirits---mezcal and cachaça are always present in my home bar---or attempting to create a new cocktail altogether.

Below are a few of my favorite authoral drinks, which I have poorly named. Please let me know if you think of better names for them. A few general remarks:

- As a successful Mathematician, I am terrible with quantities. Most of the drinks are based on proportions. Do not hold me accountable for those, I hardly measure anything on the kitchen/bar.
- Egg white creates a foam layer on top of a drink. To do that, add all ingredients (including the egg white) to a shaker without ice and shake like your life depends on it for 30 seconds. Then open the shaker, check that the egg white has foamed, add ice, and shake again. If you are making more than one drink, the foam is usually at the end, so pour half of each glass and only then complete them as opposed to filling one glass and then the other.
- Simple syrup is very simple to make: boil 1 part water, add 1 part sugar, and mix it until it dissolves. Variations on simple syrup require another ingredient (yerba mate, coffee, rosemary leaves) to be added along with the sugar, but remember to strain it well.

### Ginmarrão

- 1 1/2 oz. of Mezcal
- 1 oz. of Gin
- Orange bitters
- 1 lemon juice (squeezed)
- 1/2 oz. yerba-mate simple syrup (1/2 part yerba mate, 1 part sugar, 1 part water, strain well)
- 1/2 egg white
- [Trader Joe's Spiced Cider](https://www.clubtraderjoes.com/2012/11/trader-joes-spiced-apple-cider.html)
- Cinnamon powder

This is the cocktail I have spent years trying to make: a variation on the typical yerba-mate drink from South Brazil, where I am from, the chimarrão. I don't particularly need the flavor of egg white in this cocktail, but it makes the cool foam on top which anyone from Porto Alegre knows is essential to a trustworhy chimarrão. I also would want to try to pour this on a coupe glass, without ice. Garnish with lemon peel, and maybe some yerba mate on the side of the glass.

### Smoky Fall Punch

<img align="left" src="images/cocktails/cider.JPG" width="300" height="350" style="float:left; padding-right:30px">

- 1 1/2 oz. of Mezcal
- 1 1/2 oz. of Cachaça
- Angostura bitters
- 1/2 lemon juice (squeezed)
- 1/2 egg white
- [Trader Joe's Spiced Cider](https://www.clubtraderjoes.com/2012/11/trader-joes-spiced-apple-cider.html)
- Cinnamon powder

Again, shake the ingredients dry first to foam the egg white. Cachaça and Mezcal are a perfect pairing: smokyness and sweetness counterbalance each ohter in this cocktail. I used a lowball class, but i am imagining this would look very cool in a cooper mug like a Moscow Mule. Garnish with a lemon wheel, some cinnamon powder on top of the foam, a cinnamon stick, or all of those!

### Athens Mule

<img style="float: right;" src="../images/cocktails/athens.png">

- 1 1/2 oz. of Tsipouroc
- 1/2 oz. of Ouzo (optional, replace with more Tsipouroc)
- 1/2 lime juice (squeezed)
- Ginger Beer

This is a highball, no need to shake. Simply pour everything over ice and garnish with a lime wheel. Ouzo tastes like anise, which I love and many people hate.

### Piña Queimada

<img style="float: right;" src="../images/cocktails/pina.png">

- 1 oz. of Malibu Coconut Rum
- 1 oz. of Mezcal
- 1/2 lime juice (squeezed)
- Coconut cream
- Pineapple juice

Mezcal and pineapple are another perfect match. This Piña Colada variation has a smoky kick, and the lime juice adds some citrus freshness. Must be shaken. For a less sweet, more alcoholic version, repalce the Malibu rum with plain white rum. Also works if you replace the coconut cream with half and half (but then keep the malibu).

### Pomegranate Mezcalita

<img style="float: right;" src="../images/cocktails/pomegranate.png">

- 1 1/2 oz. of Mezcal
- 1/2 oz. of Pomegranate Liquor
- 1/2 oz. of simple syrup
- 1/2 lime juice (squeezed)
- Pineapple juice

Mezcal and pineapple again, but now with some pomegrante to sweeten this duo. Look at this color! Garnish with some cayenne pepper and salt on the rim: spicyness goes really well against this sweetness.
