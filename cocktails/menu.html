  Welcome to our apartment, Lowri!!
</div>

<div class="intro">
  As you should know, make yourself at home. If you think we might have anything and can't find it… we most likely do; let me know.

<ul>
  <li>
    Run through my spice rack and cook yourself some Indian food! Fun spice highlights include
    black stone flower (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parmotrema_perlatum" target="_blank">learn more</a>),
    a homemade pumpkin spice blend, and galangal. I have a handheld electric spice grinder in the
    bottom shelf of the cupboard.
  </li>

  <li>
    Read a book to become cultured! I would recommend you learn more about your own people via reading
    <em>The Fight for Manod</em> — a novel detailing the life of a Welsh town planner
    (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Fight_for_Manod" target="_blank">link</a>) — or learn
    more about my people via reading <em>The Time in the Wind</em> — the first novel in a saga of
    origin of the state of Rio Grande do Sul, Brasil
    (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/O_Tempo_e_o_Vento" target="_blank">link</a>).
    Or learn more about Arkadiy’s people via reading <em>Lavash at First Sight</em>, a smut book about
    Armenian lesbians who meet in a food competition
    (<a href="https://www.taleenvoskuni.com/lavash-at-first-sight" target="_blank">link</a>).
  </li>

  <li>
    Pull out the KitchenAid (she is a bit clunky to get out, btw — you will need to remove the coffee
    grinder and the food processor; let me know if you want a demo or help) and bake! You can use the
    dough hook (pro tip: first mix with the paddle until everything is a ball, then dough hook only
    on speeds 1 and 2) to perfect your bread making. I have red bean paste and black sesame paste in
    the fridge! I also have a KitchenAid ice cream maker attachment in the cupboard — you need to
    chill it for one day in the fridge before using, but then you can make your own tasty gelato!
  </li>

  <li>
    Get wasted — but not too much that you forget to feed Mezzi! While we have a vast collection, I
    think you might be interested in these three recipes curated for you:
    <ul>
      <li>
        <em><strong>Eggnog</strong></em>: It’s in a bottle in the fridge; shake and pour. Garnish with
        some freshly grated nutmeg.
      </li>
      <li>
        <em><strong>Pumpkin Spice Russian</strong></em>: 1–1.5 oz of pumpkin spice syrup (fridge,
        bottom shelf), 1.5 oz vodka, shake and pour over ice, top with 0.5 oz heavy cream. By the way,
        we may need to throw away the heavy cream that has already been opened in the fridge…
      </li>
      <li>
        <em><strong>Lowri’s Perfect Singapore Sling</strong></em>: 1.5 oz dry gin (e.g. Bombay Dry),
        1/4 oz B&B (Benedictine & brandy liqueur, bottom of fireplace), 1/4 oz dry curaçao (for sweeter,
        use Mandarine Napoleon), 1/2 oz cherry liqueur (Luxardo Sangue Morlacco — dark red, not too
        sweet; please try neat!), 3 oz pineapple juice (Dole cans in fridge bottom shelf),
        1/2–1 oz lime or lemon juice (to taste), Angostura bitters. Optional: swap the cherry liqueur
        for elderberry or açaí liqueur.
